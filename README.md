# GAN Environment Generation

The goal of this research project is to generate simulation environments using GANs instead of traditional procedural generation algorithms.

In order to do so, the bulk of our work is divided into several parts:
* Gather a lot of raw data
* Perform heavy pre-processing and augmentation of the data
* Decide on a GANs architecture
* Decide on the evaluation metrics that will let us know when the generated environments are satisfactory
* Compare to procedurally generated environments
